# Lynx Hackathon 2024 - Systematic Trading Strategy Project
We are Dynamic Derivatives, a team passionate about exploring the intersection of finance and technology. As we embark on the Lynx Hackathon 2024, we're thrilled to share our journey, insights, and the development process of our systematic trading strategy right here in this repository.

## Our Mission
Our goal for this hackathon is to leverage the provided preparatory materials and real market data to create a robust and innovative trading algorithm. We aim to combine our diverse backgrounds in finance, computer science, and engineering to approach systematic trading with fresh eyes and a spirit of innovation.

## Preparation and Approach
We've gone through the provided PDF document and code examples to ensure we're all on the same page. The preparatory materials have been instrumental in leveling the playing field and bringing our team up to speed on the essentials of systematic trading.

### Repository Structure
- Hackathon_Notebooks: This folder contains our work-in-progress Jupyter notebooks, where we're experimenting with the provided examples and gradually building up our trading strategy.
Quickstart_Modified.ipynb: Our enhanced version of the Quickstart notebook, incorporating initial strategy ideas.
Strategy_Development.ipynb: A comprehensive notebook where we're fleshing out our trading strategy, incorporating advanced analysis and modeling techniques.
- Libraries: Custom Python libraries developed by our team to extend the functionality of the provided evaluation.py.
- Data: A secure location for the real market data provided during the event (note: this folder will remain private and in compliance with the hackathon's data usage guidelines).
